# Windows CE Compatibility Layer (WCECL)

![Improvised Logo](logo.png)

Use WCECL to run original Windows CE applications on desktop Windows.

## This project includes

- **COREDLL**: a library that wraps Windows CE APIs and redirects calls to desktop Win32 APIs
- **SubsystemTool**: a program that allows you to modify subsystem attributes in portable executables (.EXEs)

⚠️ The project is at an early stage of development. Only one application has been confirmed to work so far.
